Foundation 5 For Codekit
==================

Foundation SCSS Template for Codekit

#Description:
I really like Foundation 5, SCSS, and Codekit. But I needed a lighter-weight setup to get up and running than what was provided on the [Foundation website](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html).

Requirements:
[Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/).
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)

Reference
[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) (Version 5)

## How to use
*You should just be able to drop this project folder into Codekit and get started. I'll flesh out this section later.*
